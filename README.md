# Hotel-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, we analyze positive and negative hotel reviews and design a model for inferring positive or negative sentiment given a review. We combine a pretrained BERT lanuguage model and a custom multi-layer perceptron to achieve this. The data source for this project is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe)
